# Fun with Java

Aimed at discovering the language while I teach others.

Start with `git checkout e1`

## Concurrency package

1. Simple thread exercise - shows basic threads API at work (sleep, interrupt, join, start)
2. Parking<String> - good to demonstrate run vs start, (un)synchronized methods and data races and the difficuly in showing short-lived threads on monitoring tools (especially if they're not named)

## Done? 

Follow up with `git checkout e2`
